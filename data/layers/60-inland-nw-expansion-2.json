Part of the broader <b>Ktunaxa Nation</b> — seven bands spanning Idaho, Montana, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.</p>\n    <p><b>Language:</b> Kutenai — a <b>language isolate</b>, unrelated to any other known language in the world. It has a distinctly musical quality.</p>\n    <p><b>Creation:</b> Oral history says they were created by <b>Kwiǂqa Nupika</b> (Quilxka Nupita), the Creator-Spirit, with a sacred duty to safeguard the land forever.</p>\n    <p><b>Territory:</b> Centered on the Kootenai River from Idaho through Montana to the falls in Montana. Broad-spectrum hunter-gatherers — white-tailed deer, elk, caribou, bear, bull trout, whitefish, camas, bitterroot, huckleberries, serviceberries. Occasional buffalo-hunting trips to Montana and salmon harvest at Kettle Falls on the Columbia.</p>\n    <p><b>Sturgeon-Nose Canoe:</b> Like the Kalispel canoe but with a sharper point — shaped like the nose of a sturgeon. Unique to this region.</p>\n    <p><b>Non-Treaty Tribe:</b> In 1855, Governor Stevens wanted to place them on a shared Montana reservation. The Idaho Kootenai <b>never signed the treaty</b> — \"none from our band went over to sign it. We never left but stayed in our homeland here.\"</p>\n    <p><b>Sun Worship:</b> The Kootenai worshipped the sun and believed in reincarnation. They believed the dead resided in the sun and would one day return to the shores of Lake Pend Oreille.</p>\n    <p><b>Declaration of War (1974):</b> When the tribe numbered only 67 people, they formally <b>declared war on the United States</b> on September 20, 1974 — a peaceful act of desperation seeking federal recognition and a land base. It worked: they were deeded 12.5 acres. Since then they've expanded and built the Kootenai River Inn Casino.</p>\n    <p><b>Sturgeon Recovery:</b> In 1991, the tribe built the first sturgeon hatchery in Indian Country, leading a groundbreaking effort to save the endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon — a species central to Ktunaxa identity.</p>\n  </div>",

It was a community gathering place for ceremonies and rituals. They are also known as Naha'u'umpu'u — \"People of the River.\"</p>\n    <p><b>Creation Story — The Great Beaver:</b> During the time of the Animal People, Beaver lived peacefully at his lodge near Rock Lake. The five Wolf Brothers killed him with spears, but not before an epic battle that shaped the entire Palouse landscape. Beaver was mortally wounded at the falls. In his death agony, he thrashed and flailed, gouging the rocks with his mighty claws and teeth, carving the sheer cliffs that surround the falls.</p>\n    <p>Beaver died at the Snake River confluence, where his giant <b>heart transformed to stone</b> — the large rock on the west side of the Palouse River still visible today. The Palus are said to have \"sprung from his heart.\"</p>\n    <p><b>Geology:</b> Created ~13,000 years ago by the catastrophic Missoula Floods — ice-dammed glacial Lake Missoula burst repeatedly, sending walls of water across eastern Washington. The floods overtopped the ancient Palouse River channel, diverting it and carving the 200-foot canyon through columnar basalt. One of the few remaining active waterfalls from this massive flood path.</p>\n    <p><b>Palouse Village:</b> The tribe's largest and oldest village (Palús) stood near the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers. Lewis and Clark noted the village in 1805. The Palouse were renowned horsemen who developed the spotted <b>Appaloosa</b> horse breed.</p>\n    <p><b>Today:</b> Washington's official state waterfall (designated 2014, championed by Washtucna elementary school students). 10,000+ years of archaeological evidence.</p>\n  </div>",

Excavation began in 1962 under Daugherty and geologist Roald Fryxell.</p>\n    <p><b>Finds:</b> Thousands of Stone Age artifacts — the oldest human remains in Washington State, radiocarbon-dated to <b>over 11,000 years before present</b>. At the time, the oldest in North America. The alcove was 40 feet wide and 25 feet deep. Continuous habitation for ~8,000 years documented in stratified deposits.</p>\n    <p><b>Mortuary practices</b> of early Plateau inhabitants confirmed from at least 12,000 years ago — ceremonial burial pits, bone tools, animal remains.</p>\n    <p><b>The Race Against the Dam:</b> Lower Monumental Dam construction was already underway. In 1965, rancher Marmes bulldozed a trench that exposed human and elk bones dated to 10,000 years. Senator Magnuson secured a presidential executive order from LBJ — <b>$1.5 million</b> for a protective cofferdam.</p>\n    <p><b>The Failure:</b> In February 1969, the reservoir filled. Water seeped through gravel beneath the cofferdam, flooding the site under <b>40 feet of water</b>. Scientists frantically covered what they could with plastic and sand, then watched helplessly.</p>\n    <p><b>Legacy:</b> The loss galvanized public opinion, leading to stronger archaeological protection laws. National Historic Landmark (1966) — one of the first in Washington. Today only the crumbling top of the cofferdam is visible from Lyons Ferry State Park. If the dams are ever breached, archaeologists plan to return.</p>\n  </div>",
