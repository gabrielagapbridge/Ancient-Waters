Part of the broader <b>Ktunaxa Nation</b> \u2014 seven bands spanning Idaho, Montana, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.</p>\n    <p><b>Language:</b> Kutenai \u2014 a <b>language isolate</b>, unrelated to any other known language in the world. It has a distinctly musical quality.</p>\n    <p><b>Creation:</b> Oral history says they were created by <b>Kwi\u01c2qa Nupika</b> (Quilxka Nupita), the Creator-Spirit, with a sacred duty to safeguard the land forever.</p>\n    <p><b>Territory:</b> Centered on the Kootenai River from Idaho through Montana to the falls in Montana. Broad-spectrum hunter-gatherers \u2014 white-tailed deer, elk, caribou, bear, bull trout, whitefish, camas, bitterroot, huckleberries, serviceberries. Occasional buffalo-hunting trips to Montana and salmon harvest at Kettle Falls on the Columbia.</p>\n    <p><b>Sturgeon-Nose Canoe:</b> Like the Kalispel canoe but with a sharper point \u2014 shaped like the nose of a sturgeon. Unique to this region.</p>\n    <p><b>Non-Treaty Tribe:</b> In 1855, Governor Stevens wanted to place them on a shared Montana reservation. The Idaho Kootenai <b>never signed the treaty</b> \u2014 \"none from our band went over to sign it. We never left but stayed in our homeland here.\"</p>\n    <p><b>Sun Worship:</b> The Kootenai worshipped the sun and believed in reincarnation. They believed the dead resided in the sun and would one day return to the shores of Lake Pend Oreille.</p>\n    <p><b>Declaration of War (1974):</b> When the tribe numbered only 67 people, they formally <b>declared war on the United States</b> on September 20, 1974 \u2014 a peaceful act of desperation seeking federal recognition and a land base. It worked: they were deeded 12.5 acres. Since then they've expanded and built the Kootenai River Inn Casino.</p>\n    <p><b>Sturgeon Recovery:</b> In 1991, the tribe built the first sturgeon hatchery in Indian Country, leading a groundbreaking effort to save the endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon \u2014 a species central to Ktunaxa identity.</p>\n  </div>",

The five Wolf Brothers killed him with spears, but not before an epic battle that shaped the entire Palouse landscape. Beaver was mortally wounded at the falls. In his death agony, he thrashed and flailed, gouging the rocks with his mighty claws and teeth, carving the sheer cliffs that surround the falls.</p>\n    <p>Beaver died at the Snake River confluence, where his giant <b>heart transformed to stone</b> \u2014 the large rock on the west side of the Palouse River still visible today.
