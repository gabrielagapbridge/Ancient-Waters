The <b>cui-ui</b> (Chasmistes cujus) is a large sucker fish found nowhere else on Earth, and its spring spawning run up the Truckee River was the most important food event of the year. Pyramid Lake also supported massive runs of <b>Lahontan cutthroat trout</b> — the largest inland trout in North America (up to 60 lbs). Their territory encompassed the Truckee River corridor from the Sierra foothills to the lake, the Lake Range, and portions of the Smoke Creek Desert. Chief <b>Truckee</b> (Tru-ki-zo) guided John C. Frémont across the desert in 1844. His grandson <b>Chief Numaga</b> (\"The Generous One\") initially counseled peace but led the Northern Paiute to victory at the <b>First Battle of Pyramid Lake</b> (1860) — one of the worst military defeats of settlers in the American West. His granddaughter <b>Sarah Winnemucca</b> became America's first published Native American woman author.

Their territory included the Lahontan Reservoir area, Stillwater Wildlife Refuge, and the desert playas south and east of Fallon.

The government intended to concentrate all Western Shoshone here, but most bands — especially the Te-Moak — refused to relocate from their ancestral territories. Northern Paiute from Oregon were then encouraged to join. Today it is a mixed <b>Shoshone-Paiute</b> community. The reservation covers 289,819 acres (453 sq mi) along the Owyhee River — one of the largest reservations in the western U.S. The Owyhee River provides irrigation for farming and ranching. Both Shoshone and Paiute languages and traditions are maintained. The annual <b>Duck Valley Festival</b> brings the community together each June.</div><div style=\"margin-top:8px;font-size:11px;color:#b0a090;border-top:1px solid rgba(193,154,107,0.2);padding-top:6px\">\n        <b>Key dates:</b> 1877: Duck Valley Reservation established by executive order • 1886: Northern Paiute begin joining Western Shoshone • Te-Moak bands refuse relocation • 289,819 acres — one of the largest reservations in western U.S.</div><div style=\"margin-top:6px;font-size:10px;color:#888\">Sources: Steward 1938; Crum 1994; Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley; BIA</div></div>",

The Pahrump people cultivated small garden plots and gathered extensively from the surrounding desert and mountains. Their territory extended into the Amargosa Desert and parts of the Spring Mountains. Unlike the Las Vegas and Moapa bands, the Pahrump Paiute do not have a large federal reservation, but maintain their cultural identity as a distinct Southern Paiute band.</div><div style=\"margin-top:8px;font-size:11px;color:#b0a090;border-top:1px solid rgba(193,154,107,0.2);padding-top:6px\">\n        <b>Key dates:</b> Traditional territory centered on Pah-Rimpi springs • ~1100 CE: Southern Paiute arrive in area • Contact period: Mormon and mining impacts • Pahrump Band maintains cultural identity</div><div style=\"margin-top:6px;font-size:10px;color:#888\">Sources: Kelly 1934; Kelly & Fowler 1986; NV Indian Commission; Neon Museum Indigenous Peoples guide</div></div>",

They are powerful river farmers who grew corn, beans, squash, and melons on the Colorado River floodplain. Their territory in Nevada is small — the southernmost tip along the Colorado River near Laughlin — but their cultural influence is vast. <b>Avi Kwa Ame</b> (Spirit Mountain), visible from their territory, is central to their creation story: the creator spirit <b>Mastamho</b> led the Mojave from Spirit Mountain to the Colorado River. The Fort Mojave Reservation spans Nevada, Arizona, and California. The tribe is known for their distinctive <b>body tattooing</b>, elaborate dream narratives, and the <b>keruk</b> (mourning ceremony). Unlike most Great Basin peoples, the Mojave had a tribal chief structure and fought organized battles.</div><div style=\"margin-top:8px;font-size:11px;color:#b0a090;border-top:1px solid rgba(193,154,107,0.2);padding-top:6px\">\n        <b>Key dates:</b> ~1200 CE: Mojave established on Colorado River • 1604: Spanish explorer Oñate encounters Mojave • 1858-59: Mojave War with U.S. Army • 1880: Fort Mojave Reservation established • 2023: Avi Kwa Ame National Monument designated</div><div style=\"margin-top:6px;font-size:10px;color:#888\">Sources: Kroeber 1925; Stewart 1983 (HNAI); Fort Mojave Indian Tribe; Avi Kwa Ame NM</div></div>",
