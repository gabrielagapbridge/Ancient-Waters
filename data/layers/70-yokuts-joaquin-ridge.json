Multiple archaeological sites are recorded here, including Birdwell Rock (CA-FRE-2244), Cupule Point (CA-FRE-2109), and Joaquin Mill (CA-FRE-1345). The complex includes pecked petroglyphs, cupules (small pecked pits considered among the oldest rock art in California), bedrock mortars, and ceremonial artifacts.<br><br>Crespin proposed the sites functioned as a shamanic ceremonial landscape \u2014 a place of ritual isolation for youth initiation rites (involving toloache/Datura), winter solstice observation, and weather shamanism. The Yokuts considered rock art to be <i>tripne</i> (supernatural) and shamans cached ceremonial paraphernalia at such sites.<br><br><b>Sources:</b> GJHikes/Rex Nye Map \u00b7 Crespin 2002 (CA Prehistory Proc.
