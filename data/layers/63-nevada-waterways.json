Bands were named for the foods they gathered along its course. For emigrants on the <b>California Trail</b> (1840s-1860s), the Humboldt was the essential — if hated — highway across the Great Basin. Mark Twain called it <i>\"the most villainous river\"</i> in America. The final stretch from Lovelock to the Sink, followed by the <b>Forty Mile Desert</b> to the Carson River, was the deadliest section of the entire California Trail.<br><br>The Humboldt River Basin covers <b>16,840 square miles</b> — the largest sub-basin in the entire Great Basin.

Emigrants crossed at night to avoid the heat. The desert was littered with dead oxen, abandoned wagons, and scattered goods. Thousands made this crossing during the Gold Rush (1849-1860s). For indigenous peoples, this was simply part of the landscape — Northern Paiute bands knew the springs and water sources that emigrants could not find.</div>\n      <div style=\"margin-top:6px;font-size:10px;color:#888\">Sources: California Trail Center; Cline 1963; NV Historical Society</div></div>",
