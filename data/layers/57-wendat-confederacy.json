Produced enormous surpluses traded to Algonquian neighbors for furs, copper, wampum. Trade networks reached the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay.</p>\n    <p><b>Society:</b> Matrilineal descent. Longhouses up to 90m long. Villages of 20-35 longhouses relocated every 10-15 years as soil/timber depleted. Estimated 600 village sites across the region.</p>\n    <p><b>Destruction:</b> Epidemics 1634-1640 reduced population to ~12,000. Haudenosaunee attacks 1648-1649 destroyed the Confederacy. By May 1649, the Wendat burned 15 of their own villages to prevent stores from being taken and fled.</p>\n    <p><b>Survival:</b> ~10,000 fled to Christian Island (Gahoendoe). Most starved over winter 1649-50.

From the 13th century, communities began migrating ~100 km northward to the historic Huronia area near Georgian Bay. The consolidation was complete by ~1600.</p>\n    <p><b>Why move north?</b> Possibly to distance from Haudenosaunee, and to access trade routes via Lake Nipissing to French traders on the St. Lawrence. Also to trade with Algonquian peoples for beaver pelts.</p>\n    <p><b>Toronto:</b> The word likely comes from Mohawk \"Tkarón:to\" (tree in the water), referring to ancient fishing weirs at the narrows between Lakes Simcoe and Couchiching. Wendat called these narrows \"Karonto\" (log lying in the water). Archaeological stakes at the fish weirs date to 2610 BCE — 4,500 years old.</p>\n  </div>",
