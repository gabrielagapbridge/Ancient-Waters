In precontact times, Steamboat featured a <b>70-foot geyser</b> and roughly 20 smaller ones \u2014 one of the largest geyser fields in the world. Pioneer journals noted <b>60-70 columns of steam</b> visible from miles away.<br><br>For all Great Basin peoples, hot springs were <b>places of healing</b> \u2014 the heated water and mineral mud could relieve pain and illness. But they were not recreational: it was essential to <b>leave offerings and prayers</b>. To misuse sacred springs was to risk spiritual consequences.<br><br>After Euro-Americans arrived, Steamboat was converted into a luxury bathhouse, severing its spiritual purpose. Early photographs show Washoe and Paiute women doing laundry at the springs \u2014 pushed to the margins of their own sacred site. The geothermal field remains active today, though the great geyser is long gone.</div>\n      <div style=\"margin-top:6px;font-size:10px;color:#888\">Sources: Travel Nevada; UNR Special Collections; Finding Nevada Wild; d'Azevedo 1986</div></div>"
