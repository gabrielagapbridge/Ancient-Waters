His greatest challenge was the sorcerer Tadodaho of the Onondaga, whose body was twisted and whose hair was a tangle of writhing snakes — symbolizing the disorder of his violent mind.</p>\n    <p><b>The Solar Eclipse:</b> The Seneca demanded a sign. The Peacemaker told them to look to the sky. They witnessed the sun turn black — a total solar eclipse. Many scholars date the League’s founding to <b>1142 AD</b> based on eclipse records.</p>\n    <p><b>Combing the Snakes:</b> Hiawatha combed the snakes from Tadodaho’s hair and straightened his twisted body. Rather than destroy him, they made him the Firekeeper — spiritual leader of the Confederacy. The title Tadodaho continues today.</p>\n    <p><b>The Tree of Peace:</b> The Peacemaker uprooted a great white pine and the nations buried their weapons beneath it. The tree was replanted with roots stretching in four directions — the Great White Roots of Peace. An eagle watches from the top. Five needles per bundle = five nations.</p>\n    <p><b>The Hiawatha Belt:</b> Wampum recording the founding — five symbols joined by a path. This design became the Flag of the Iroquois Confederacy.</p>\n    <p><b>Today:</b> One of the most polluted lakes in the United States — mercury, salt, industrial waste. The Onondaga Nation filed a land rights action: \"Onondaga Lake is the birthplace of Haudenosaunee democracy... and should be protected as a national treasure instead of the chemical cesspool it has become.\"</p>\n    <p><b>Sources:</b> Onondaga Nation; Haudenosaunee Confederacy; Sacred Land Film Project; History.com</p>\n  </div>",

The earth opened at Kanandague, allowing the first Seneca people to step into the world.</p>\n    <p><b>Genundewa</b> stands adjacent — sacred mountain of the Seneca since before recorded memory. The Seneca name themselves <b>Onödowá’ga</b> — \"People of the Great Hill\" — in reference to this place.</p>\n    <p><b>The Great Serpent:</b> A boy found a beautiful snake and kept it as a pet. It grew enormous, consuming mice, then rabbits, then deer. When deer grew scarce, it eyed the people. Warriors killed it on Bare Hill — the round stones in the shallow waters are said to be skulls of those it killed.</p>\n    <p><b>Ancient Fort:</b> First recorded 1825 by Tuscarora historian David Cusick — traces of a fort covering ~1 acre, surrounded by a ditch and wall. The stones were \"ancient when the first Seneca found them.\"</p>\n    <p><b>Ring of Fire:</b> The Genundowa Festival of Lights continues annually — a bonfire atop Bare Hill signals flares around the entire shore of Canandaigua Lake, recreating the ancient celebration of gratitude.</p>\n    <p><b>Status:</b> Bare Hill Unique Area, acquired by New York State beginning 1989.</p>\n  </div>",
