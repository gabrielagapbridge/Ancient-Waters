Linguistic and archaeological evidence suggests the Esselen represent a population that was in place before the Penutian-speaking Ohlone expanded southward.

Miwokan speakers occupied a vast territory from the Marin/Sonoma coast through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to the western Sierra Nevada foothills. The standard model (Moratto 1984) holds that Penutian speakers migrated into California from the Great Basin or Columbia Plateau, gradually displacing or absorbing earlier Hokan populations. However, a 2022 PNAS genomics study on Ohlone populations found that genetic and linguistic histories don't always align neatly, suggesting the process was more complex than simple population replacement.</div><div style=\"font-size:11px;color:#aaa;margin:4px 0\"><strong>Languages:</strong> Coast Miwok, Lake Miwok, Bay Miwok (Saclan), Plains Miwok, Northern Sierra Miwok, Central Sierra Miwok, Southern Sierra Miwok</div><div style=\"font-size:11px;color:#aaa;margin:4px 0\"><strong>Status:</strong> All Miwokan languages are severely endangered.
