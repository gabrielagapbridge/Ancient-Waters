Lake Coeur d'Alene sat at its center — a 25-mile-long, 3-mile-wide body of water fed by the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers.</p>\n    <p><b>Villages:</b> Permanent villages lined the shores of the lake and its tributary rivers — the Coeur d'Alene, St. Joe, Clark Fork, and Spokane Rivers, as well as Hayden Lake and Lake Pend Oreille. Unlike Plains tribes, the Schitsu'umsh were not nomadic.</p>\n    <p><b>Subsistence:</b> Salmon, trout, whitefish, sturgeon. Camas root was a dietary staple — blue camas flowers carpeted the prairies so thickly the meadows appeared as water. The Upper Columbia tribes (Coeur d'Alene, Kalispel, Kootenai, Spokane) harvested an estimated <b>644,469 salmon annually</b> totaling 6.8 million pounds.</p>\n    <p><b>\"Heart of an Awl\":</b> French fur traders named them \"Coeur d'Alene\" — meaning sharp-hearted, shrewd — because they were the finest traders in the region.</p>\n    <p><b>Supreme Court Victory:</b> In <b>Idaho v. United States (2001)</b>, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Coeur d'Alene Tribe holds rightful ownership of the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and related waters — affirming their sovereignty over the sacred lake.</p>\n    <p><b>Superfund Crisis:</b> 72 million tons of mine waste were dumped into the Coeur d'Alene watershed over 100 years of silver mining. The Silver Valley became the nation's second-largest Superfund site. In 1991 the tribe filed a landmark environmental lawsuit — one of the largest natural resource damage cases in American history.</p>\n    <p><b>~200 archaeological sites</b> have been documented around the lake, many kept confidential to prevent looting.</p>\n  </div>",

Father Pierre-Jean De Smet arrived in 1842.</p>\n    <p><b>First Mission:</b> The St. Joe Mission was built along the St. Joe River in 1842 but abandoned due to seasonal flooding. A new site was chosen in 1846 on a grassy hill above the Coeur d'Alene River — the present location.</p>\n    <p><b>Construction:</b> Built 1850-53 by Jesuits and Coeur d'Alene tribal members using only a broad-axe, auger, rope & pulleys, pen-knife, and improvised whipsaw. \"Wattle and daub\" technique — hand-hewn logs latticed with saplings, woven with grass, caked with mud.</p>\n    <p><b>The Ceiling:</b> Stained blue with <b>huckleberries</b> hand-picked and pressed into the wood. Walls decorated with fabric from Hudson's Bay Company and hand-painted newspaper from Philadelphia. Father Ravalli carved wooden statues by hand with nothing but a knife, painted to resemble marble.</p>\n    <p><b>Architect:</b> Father Anthony Ravalli, a Jesuit from Ferrara, Italy. The style is \"simplified Baroque\" — Greek Revival portico with modified Tuscan columns and Baroque pediment.</p>\n    <p><b>Mullan Road:</b> Captain John Mullan used the mission as headquarters while building the 624-mile military road from Fort Walla Walla to Fort Benton (completed 1862). Tens of thousands of gold seekers passed within feet of the mission.</p>\n    <p><b>Today:</b> National Historic Landmark (1961). National Register of Historic Places (1966). Over 100,000 visitors annually — most-visited heritage park in Idaho. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe makes an annual pilgrimage every August 15 for the Feast of the Assumption, setting up teepees on the mission grounds. A mural of the mission adorns the Brumidi Corridors at the U.S. Capitol — the only landscape there showing a building that still exists.</p>\n  </div>",
