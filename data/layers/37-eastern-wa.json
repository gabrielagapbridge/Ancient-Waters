Scrapers and a crescent-shaped tool.</p>\n    <p><b>Significance:</b> One of fewer than 20 Clovis caches in all of North America.

College students Will Thomas and David Deacy, wading to watch hydroplane races at Columbia Park, Kennewick. Thomas’s foot struck a skull in ~50 cm of water. They took it to police in a plastic bucket. Coroner Floyd Johnson called forensic anthropologist James Chatters.</p>\n    <p><b>The skeleton:</b> 350+ bones — one of the most complete ancient skeletons in the Americas. Male, 40–50 years, ~5’7”–5’9”. Right-handed (right arm larger from spearfishing). A Cascade-type stone point embedded in right hip — healed over, meaning he survived. Additional healed injuries: rib fracture, skull depressions. Arthritis in elbow, knees, vertebrae.</p>\n    <p><b>The 20-year controversy:</b> Chatters described the skull as \"Caucasoid\" and produced a reconstruction resembling Patrick Stewart. Five tribes (Colville, Umatilla, Yakama, Wanapum, Nez Perce) sought reburial under NAGPRA. Eight scientists sued. Battle reached the 9th Circuit. Remains held at Burke Museum 1998–2017.</p>\n    <p><b>DNA resolution (2015):</b> Rasmussen & Willerslev (Univ. Copenhagen) extracted DNA from a hand bone. Published in Nature: genetically closer to modern Native Americans than any other population, with affinity to Columbia Plateau tribes. Colville Tribe provided 24 DNA samples. Confirmed by Univ. Chicago (2016). Chatters himself changed his mind.</p>\n    <p><b>Reburial:</b> Congress passed WIIN Act (Dec. 2016).
