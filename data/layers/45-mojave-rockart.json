Ubiquitous along the southern Antelope Valley on schist and metamorphic boulders. Age and cultural associations debated; may predate other rock art forms by millennia. Possibly associated with <b>fertility or increase rites</b>.<br><br>\n\n<b style=\"color:#FF7043\">🪨 Petroglyphs (Pecked/Carved)</b><br>\nThe most common form. Dark <b>desert varnish</b> on lighter rock provides the perfect medium. The <b>Coso Range</b> alone contains 100,000+ petroglyphs — the largest concentration in the Western Hemisphere. Bighorn sheep dominate (~50% of Coso images). Linked to <b>hunting magic, shamanic vision quests, and increase rites</b>.<br><br>\n\n<b style=\"color:#F44336\">🎨 Pictographs (Painted)</b><br>\nLess common but often more elaborate. Styles include the <b>Southern Sierra Style</b> (polychrome, Kitanemuk), <b>Southern California Rectilinear Abstract</b>, and cave paintings associated with <b>puberty ceremonies</b>. Found in rock shelters, overhangs, and caves where paint is protected from weathering.<br><br>\n\n<b style=\"color:#CE93D8\">◆ Geoglyphs & Intaglios</b><br>\nLarge-scale ground drawings visible from above. The <b>Blythe Intaglios</b> and other Colorado River corridor geoglyphs are part of Yuman <b>Creation Mythology</b> — depicting gods, animals, and spirit beings.<br><br>\n\n<b>Key scholars:</b> David Whitley, Albert Knight, Mark Q.
