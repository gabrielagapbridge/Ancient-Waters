This is the site that Georgia Lee and Stephen Horne identified in 1978 as the place described in Chumash mythology by María Solares to anthropologist J.P. Harrington in the 1920s. Solares described a sacred place near the Cuyama Valley with a spring or pond of water, painted depictions of mythic beings, and a cave where Coyote turned to stone after the Great Flood. The site consists of two rockshelters (SBa-502 upper cave; SBa-526 lower/adjacent). A <b>prominent disc shape</b> painted on the ceiling of the upper cave gave the entire site its name — it represents <b>Qsi, the Sun</b>. Nearby is a smaller black circle with a red rim that may be an <b>eclipse symbol</b>. Other circular designs on cave walls and rock faces represent celestial bodies. Fernando Librado, another Harrington informant, remembered a painted sun symbol as a circle and rays. The circular shape of the sanddollar was linked to the sun in Chumash cosmology.<br><br>The site sits at ~5,000 feet on the <b>Sierra Madre Ridge</b> at the edge of <b>Montgomery Potrero</b>. Five named springs surround the site (Montgomery Springs), and in most years a large pond formed from spring overflow. Chumash visited for specific rituals and ceremonies between May and November, when highland foraging, hunting, and solstice rituals drew tribelets — some on their way to the Tejon over the mountains to Yokuts territory. This was never a permanent village — at this elevation it was strictly a seasonal ceremonial destination.<br><br>The entire nine-mile Sierra Madre Ridge is considered sacred ground. Scattered across three conjoined potreros (Montgomery, Pine Corral, Salisbury) are enormous <b>'whale rocks'</b> — massive sandstone formations understood as the petrified remains of the <b>First People</b> who turned to stone after the mythological Great Flood. Animals like Golden Eagle (Slo'w) and the Sun (Qsi) were among these First People.</div>\n      <div style=\"font-size:10px;color:#888;margin-top:6px;border-top:1px solid rgba(230,81,0,0.2);padding-top:4px;\">\n        <b>Culture:</b> Cuyama / Ineseño (Samala) Chumash<br>\n        <b>Sources:</b> Lee & Horne 1978; Hudson & Underhay 1978; Harrington field notes; McCaslin 2016; Robinson 2011\n      </div>\n    </div>",

Reeves, Bury, and Robinson (2009) conducted experimental pigment processing to determine whether the exotic colors at nearby Pleito (CA-KER-77) came from Spanish mission sources or local minerals. Their experiments demonstrated that locally available copper carbonate minerals (azurite/malachite) from a quarry northeast of San Emigdio Mountain could produce the blue and green pigments — suggesting the polychrome tradition predates European contact. Chumash mythology specifically mentions 'blue-rock paint' in association with the Emigdiano people. The mineral quarry was known to exist within Emigdiano territory. Five Chumash rock art sites in the Wind Wolves Preserve were examined using portable X-ray fluorescence, revealing multiple pigments and painting episodes at each panel — indicating the art was created by multiple artists or retouched over long periods.</div>\n      <div style=\"font-size:10px;color:#888;margin-top:6px;border-top:1px solid rgba(230,81,0,0.2);padding-top:4px;\">\n        <b>Culture:</b> Emigdiano Chumash<br>\n        <b>Sources:</b> Reeves, Bury & Robinson 2009; Robinson 2006, 2010\n      </div>\n    </div>",

María Solares told Harrington in 1927 that 'nearly the entire environment was personified and was often interpreted in a supernatural manner.' These rocks are alive in Chumash understanding.

The capital village of <b>Syukhtun</b> (modern Santa Barbara) was one of the largest settlements on the Pacific Coast. The famous <b>Chumash Painted Cave</b> (Alaxuluxen) sits along the trail from Syukhtun over San Marcos Pass. Population estimated at 15,000+ before European contact. Language: Barbareño — nearly extinct, but documentation exists from Harrington's work with Fernando Librado and other elders.</div>\n      <div style=\"font-size:10px;color:#888;margin-top:6px;\">Sources: Kroeber 1925; Grant 1965, 1978; Johnson 1978, 1988; Robinson 2010; NPS; Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians</div>\n    </div>",

When the island grew crowded, Earth Mother Hutash built a <b>rainbow bridge</b> (wishtoyo) from the island's tallest peak to Tzchimoos (the tall mountain near Carpinteria).
