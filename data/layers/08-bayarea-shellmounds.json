USGS studies (Pestrong 1972; Atwater 1977) show Richardson Bay was transformed from a V-shaped Pleistocene stream valley into a shallow estuary over the past 10,000 years, with stable salt marsh forming by ~4,600 BP near present-day Mill Valley. Before 1850, the northwest end of Richardson Bay was fringed by extensive tidal marsh grading into seasonal wetlands — the \"hard\" shoreline we see today is entirely artificial (bay fill, rip-rap, Highway 101 causeway). CA-MRN-27 would have sat directly at the marsh-to-oak woodland edge, a classic Coast Miwok winter village placement: sheltered from bay winds by gentle hills, with immediate access to tidal mudflats rich in clams and mussels, while the surrounding oak-buckeye woodland provided the acorn harvest that sustained them through winter. This location reflects the SEASONAL ROUND of the Huimen tribelet: winter/early spring at bayshore villages harvesting shellfish, waterfowl (mudhens, geese), and stored acorns; spring migration to coastal sites for salmon, herring runs, seaweed, and tide pool foraging; summer dispersal to upland camps on the flanks of Mt. Tamalpais and surrounding ridges for seed gathering, deer hunting, and controlled burns to manage grasslands; and autumn return to oak groves for the intensive acorn harvest that marked the Miwok new year. Richardson Bay's 5 Strawberry Point shellmounds (MRN-17 through MRN-21) plus sites like MRN-27 represent the winter anchor points of this annual cycle.<div class=\"popup-src\">📖 Barrow (2009); Nelson (1909); Pestrong (1972) USGS Richardson Bay sedimentation; Atwater (1977); Van Dyke (1972); Schneider (2013) \"Placing Refuge\"; Sausalito Historical Society; California Frontier Project</div>"

USGS studies (Pestrong 1972; Atwater 1977) document that Richardson Bay was transformed from a Pleistocene stream valley to an estuary beginning ~10,000 years ago as sea level rose through the Golden Gate at ~2 cm/year. By 4,600 BP, stable salt marsh had formed at the northwest end near Mill Valley. Before 1850, nearly the entire perimeter of Richardson Bay was fringed by extensive tidal marshes grading into seasonal wetlands, wet meadows, and willow thickets — up to hundreds of meters wide in places. The Bothin Marsh preserve is the last remnant of these once-vast marshlands. Strawberry Spit and Aramburu Island did not exist — they were created in the 1950s-60s from dredge spoils. Paradise Cay was open marshland. Over 80% of SF Bay's original tidal marshes have been destroyed by fill, diking, and development since 1850. The Alameda Native History Project (Gabriel Duncan, Paiute) reconstructed the pre-1900 shoreline using NOAA survey data, revealing how dramatically the bay's edges have changed. All shellmound sites around Richardson Bay (Nelson documented 5 on Strawberry Point alone) originally sat at the marsh-woodland interface — the richest ecological zone for Coast Miwok subsistence.<div class=\"popup-src\">📖 Pestrong (1972) \"Holocene Sedimentation in Richardson Bay\"; Atwater (1977; 1979); Alameda Native History Project; SFEI Bay Shore Inventory; Audubon Richardson Bay Sanctuary</div>"
