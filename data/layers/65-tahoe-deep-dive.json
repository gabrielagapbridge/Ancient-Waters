Pluto</b> erupted, creating a volcanic dam that raised ancient lake levels hundreds of feet above today. During the Pleistocene, glaciers carved Emerald Bay, Cascade Lake, and Fallen Leaf Lake, and repeatedly dammed the <b>Truckee River</b> outlet — sometimes raising the lake 170 meters above modern levels. When ice dams broke, <b>catastrophic jökulhlaups</b> (glacial outburst floods) roared down the Truckee, carrying house-sized boulders as far as Verdi.<br><br>63 streams flow in. Only one — the <b>Truckee River</b> — flows out. The water never reaches the ocean.<br><br>During the mid-Holocene (4,000-7,000 years ago), extended drought dropped the lake <b>below its natural rim</b>, cutting off the Truckee entirely. Submerged trees confirm this ancient low stand. The lake has dropped below its rim again in recent droughts — a haunting echo of that ancient cycle.</div>\n      <div style=\"margin-top:6px;font-size:10px;color:#888\">Sources: USGS; Birkeland 1964; Hyne et al. 1972; Keep Tahoe Blue; Washoe Tribe</div></div>",

Created by the <b>Martis Culture</b> (~2000 BCE–500 CE), the earliest known inhabitants of the high Sierra.<br><br>The Martis left behind petroglyphs, mortars, metates, and basalt projectile points across the northern Sierra. Their rock art is classified as <b>Style 7: High Sierra Abstract-Representational</b> — circles, spirals, wavy lines, bear tracks, and deer tracks. There are 92+ known Martis petroglyph sites, but most locations are kept confidential to prevent vandalism.<br><br>The Martis hunted with <b>atlatls</b> (spear-throwers) and worked almost exclusively in basalt. When the bow-and-arrow arrived (~500 CE) and the climate grew drier, the Martis vanished. The <b>Kings Beach Complex</b> succeeded them around the lake — possibly ancestral to the Washoe, though the relationship is debated.
