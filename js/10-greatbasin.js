Heizer & Baumhoff (1962) used Coso to develop their <b>hunting magic hypothesis</b> — that petroglyphs were rituals to ensure successful hunts.

    <h3 style="color:#B0BEC5">⬢ Tule Springs Hearth Site (35Ha406)</h3>
    <p><b>Site number:</b> 35Ha406</p>
    <p><b>Date:</b> ~1,800–600 years ago (Rosegate period) with limited later use</p>
    <p><b>Culture:</b> Late prehistoric Great Basin peoples; historically <b>Burns Northern Paiute</b> gathering area</p>
    <p><b>Location:</b> Eastern Alvord Basin, Pueblo Valley, east side of Steens Mountain, Harney County, Oregon. ~90 miles SE of Burns. Elevation ~4,100 ft. (42.38°N, 118.58°W)</p>
    <p><b>Discovery & excavation:</b> Excavated early summer 1980 by the <b>Steens Mountain Prehistory Project</b>, directed by C. Melvin Aikens (University of Oregon), with James D. Wilde as field supervisor. Field school students from the universities of Oregon, Washington, and Washington State University participated.</p>
    <p><b>The site:</b> Named for a large charcoal hearth exposed by wheeled traffic on a narrow desert road. The hearth — a roughly circular distribution of charcoal and dark, greasy sand, ~1.5–2 sq meters — sat in a low swale between stabilized spring dunes formed of pluvial lake sediments. The site spans approximately 100 × 60 meters (~6,000 sq meters) on the valley floor, about 500 m north of Tule Springs marsh.</p>
    <p><b>Stratigraphy:</b> A single cultural component (Stratum C, 6–15 cm depth) resting on an older weathered soil horizon (Stratum D). Wind deflation had stripped artifacts onto surfaces flanking the dune, while the dune itself preserved buried deposits. Sterile sediments below contained a volcanic ash layer at 241 cm depth. Rodent burrows displaced some artifacts downward but did not create false components.</p>
    <p><b>Artifacts (13,244 total):</b> 706 use-worn tools dominated by cutting implements — 57% low-angle (0–30°) cutting edges for meat and hides, 27% medium-angle (31–60°) for wood and fiber, 8% high-angle (61–90°) scraper-type for heavy cutting and hide working. Also: 26 grinding stones (seed/plant processing), 18 crushed-wear cobbles (pounding/crushing), and one ceramic spool or spindle whorl. 17 projectile points: <b>8 Rosegate</b> (corner-notched, dominant type), <b>2 Elko Eared</b> (earlier Archaic), <b>1 Cottonwood Triangular</b> (latest prehistoric), and <b>1 crescent</b> (distinctive Great Basin tool form). Over 80% of debitage was local chert, but most modified tools were obsidian — cores were reduced at quarry sites on the escarpment rim to the east, with only refined flakes brought back to camp.</p>
    <p><b>Activity areas:</b> Several distinct concentrations within the deflated surface scatter: a dense western scatter with grinding stones and fire-cracked rock (plant processing camp), a northeastern scatter (limited-use area, no grinding stones), and a southeastern scatter dominated by sharp-edged cutting tools. Low rates of tool re-use suggest raw material abundance from nearby chert outcrops.</p>
    <p><b>Marsh environment:</b> Tule Springs marsh (~100 × 500 m) supported abundant cattail (<i>Typha latifolia</i>), bulrush (<i>Scirpus</i> spp.), and sedges (<i>Juncus</i> spp.). Surrounding dunes stabilized by greasewood, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, and sagebrush. Seep springs lined with wild rose, buckberry (<i>Shepherdia argentea</i>), and Great Basin wild rye (<i>Elymus cinereus</i>) — nearly all ethnobotanically important species.</p>
    <p><b>Burns Northern Paiute connection:</b> Paiute women reported traveling with their families over Steens Mountain to the Tule Springs area to collect buckberry, rye, bulrush, and other plant species (Couture et al. 1986). Procurement of lithic raw material, animals, chokecherry, and other resources was embedded in this seasonal trek to and from the Alvord Basin.</p>
    <p><b>Climate & settlement pattern:</b> The site dates to <b>Period 6A</b> in the Steens Mountain regional chronology — a drier, warmer climatic episode beginning ~1,800 years ago. During this interval, springs and desert marshes in the Alvord Basin became <b>settlement magnets for the first time</b>. The broader pattern shows increased dispersion and mobility: many small, short-term camps rather than large permanent settlements. The Hearth site likely represents several instances of intensive short-term camping during a relatively narrow span of time, by a highly mobile population tethered to water sources but not tied to specific places.</p>
    <p><b>Significance:</b> Demonstrates how desert marsh resources drew repeated occupation during arid climatic episodes. The single-component stratigraphy allowed deflated surface scatters to be tied to the buried occupation, revealing activity areas otherwise invisible in Great Basin archaeology. One of the key sites establishing the late prehistoric settlement pattern for the Steens Mountain region.</p>
