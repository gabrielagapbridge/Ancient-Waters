  {name:'Los Gatos Creek (channelized)', desc:'Flows 24 miles from the Santa Cruz Mountains through the Santa Clara Valley to the Guadalupe River. In 1866, extreme flooding cut a new channel through what is now Willow Glen, leaving the original bed as "Dry Creek" (Dry Creek Road follows it today). In the 1920s, groundwater pumping caused San Jose to sink 13 feet — the valley\'s aquifers nearly ruined by saltwater intrusion. The 1950s construction of Highway 17 forced 6,000 feet of the creek through Los Gatos into a concrete culvert. Before dams, beaver lived in the upper creek — Captain Sutter recorded 1,500 beaver pelts sold from Mission San José alone around 1840.',

  {name:'San Francisquito Creek (leveed/straightened)', desc:'The creek that gave Palo Alto its name — El Palo Alto, a thousand-year-old coast redwood, still stands on its banks. The Ohlone left ancient village sites along the creek. Father Palou erected a cross near the great redwood in 1774. The creek was navigable by small boat to present-day Newell Road in the 1850s. In the 1920s-30s, levees were built and the creek was straightened at its outlet to the Bay, and 1,142 acres of tidal marsh at its mouth were reduced to 352 acres by airport and golf course fill. Remarkably, because San Mateo and Santa Clara counties could never agree on who would pay to channelize it, the creek remains one of the only un-concreted Bay Area streams — and now hosts the most viable remaining steelhead population in the South Bay.',

  {name:'Stevens Creek (channelized/dammed)', desc:'Once a free-flowing creek from the Santa Cruz Mountains through Cupertino to the Bay marshes near Mountain View. The Tamyen Ohlone relied on its resources for thousands of years. Stevens Creek Reservoir (1935) blocked upper flows, and much of the lower creek has been channelized for flood control through suburban Cupertino and Sunnyvale. The creek\'s historical floodplain — now Silicon Valley office parks — was once seasonal wetland sustaining vast waterfowl populations.',

  {name:'Alameda Creek (dammed/diverted)', desc:'The largest watershed draining to the South Bay — 633 square miles from the Diablo Range through Niles Canyon to the bay. Once supported the largest steelhead run in the Bay Area. Calaveras Dam (1925) and other impoundments severed the upper watershed. SFEI\'s historical ecology study reveals the creek once spread across a vast alluvial fan at Fremont, sustaining extensive willow groves and seasonal wetlands. The Ohlone village of Tuibun sat near its mouth. A rubber dam installed in Niles Canyon now blocks steelhead migration entirely during low flows — one of the most controversial fish barriers in California.',
